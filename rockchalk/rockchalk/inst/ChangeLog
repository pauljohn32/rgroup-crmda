	* ../R/plotSeq.R: allow x to be a factor, return levels if so

	* /pauljohn.plotSeq.R (plotSeq): range
	allow missings

	* ../R/plotPlane.R: new introduced function

2011-12-11  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../DESCRIPTION (Date): Version: bump

	* ../R/perspEmpty.R (perspEmpty): range(na.rm=TRUE) allow missings

	* ../R/magRange.R (magRange): range(na.rm=TRUE) to allow missings

2011-12-06  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/lmrc.R (makeRCformula): This is necessary so that all
	interactive components are included
	iv <- paste("(", gsub(":"," + ",x),")^2") 
	* Replace whole stucture to make sure x1.X.x2 coding gets used.

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): trying to fix that pesky "one
	extra variable" error in regression models

2011-12-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): fix problem when only one
	variable was left in calculating centralized predictor values. The
	bare vector has to be told "as.data.frame"

2011-12-01  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/lmrc.R (makeRCresiduals): revised bug in calculation lmrc
	was not using residual centered variables when "x1:x2" was
	included, R was constructing own product term. So necessary to
	re-name the residual centered variable connector .X.

2011-11-26  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): added option drawArrows

2011-11-05  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): insert invisible() on returns

	* ../R/rockchalk-package.R: insert dataset religioncrime and
	documentation.
	* data/religioncrime.RData: new dataset with beautiful example
	of suppression

2011-11-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* rockchalk/rockchalk/R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): more fiddling
	with interaction

	* mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): fix interaction code in lm
